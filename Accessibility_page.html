        <P>
            We achieved good accessibility through small changes. Weâ€™ve used 'alt' in html-code for to include alternative text to images which makes it easier to know what is that on the web page when navigating. Html tags are used correctly. For example The tags
            p, h3 and so one are used to determine the order to read out elements. <br> We used tabels, figures and figcaptions which makes a good structure in the webpages.

        </P>
        <p>
            In CSS Make we sure that all elements are separated from each other and the background. This should be a better design for accessibility.
        </p>
        <P>
            We used
            <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools</a> which has both an html code validator and a CSS code validator Here we show how we have done validering in all our pages.

        <h3>Welcome Page</h3>
        <img src="Bugs_Welcome.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs welcome page">
        <p>The Home page didn't have any errors,</p>

        <!--Accessibility to Booking page-->
        <h3>Booking Page</h3>
        <img src="Bugs_Booking.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs booking page">
        <p>The booking page didn't have any errors, except some contrast ones, due to the color of the pictures. We just had to change a few ones to avoid it. Otherwise, there was not other errors, as it was not a hard page to do due to its content (only
            text and pictures)</p>

    <div class="acc">
        <!--Accessibility to Menu page-->
        <h3>Menu Page</h3>
        <img src="Bugs_Menu.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs menu page">
        <p>The menu page had eight errors, but they depended on the same part of the code. The tables had tow empty &ltth&gts. We deleted the empty &ltth&gts and toke only &lttd&gt in the rows. Read about the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"
                target="_blank"> tables</a> in Html </p>

        <h3>Topical Page</h3>
        <!--Accessibility to Topical page-->
        <img src="Bugs_Topical.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs topical page">
        <p>Regarding the topical page, there were two major errors. The first was quickly corrected, it was simply a link that was supposed to be on an image but ended up on an empty space (bad positioning of the &lta&gt tag). The second is the moving logo
            at the bottom of the page which can be annoying for the user. We had to add a solution to stop the logo. We have therefore added the fact that if the mouse is over the logo, it stops.</p>
