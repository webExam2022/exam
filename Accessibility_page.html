        <p>The booking page didn't have any errors, except some contrast ones, due to the color of the pictures. We just had to change a few ones to avoid it. Otherwise, there was not other errors, as it was not a hard page to do due to its content (only
            text and pictures)</p>

        <h3>Menu Page</h3>
        <img src="Bugs_Menu.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs menu page">
        <p>The menu page had eight errors, but they depended on the same part of the code. The tables had tow empty &ltth&gts. We deleted the empty &ltth&gts and toke only &lttd&gt in the rows.

        <h3>Topical Page</h3> <!--Accessibility to Topical page-->
        <img src="Bugs_Topical.png" class="img2" alt="Bugs topical page">
        <p>Regarding the topical page, there were two major errors. The first was quickly corrected, it was simply a link that was supposed to be on an image but ended up on an empty space (bad positioning of the &lta&gt tag). The second is the moving logo
            at the bottom of the page which can be annoying for the user. We had to add a solution to stop the logo. We have therefore added the fact that if the mouse is over the logo, it stops.</p>
